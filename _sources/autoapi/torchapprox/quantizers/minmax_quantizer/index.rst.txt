   Min/Max-Quantizer container class

      Differentiable Integer Quantization node

      .. py:method:: forward(ctx, x, minmax, int_max)
         :staticmethod:

         Performs the operation.

         This function is to be overridden by all subclasses.

         It must accept a context ctx as the first argument, followed by any
         number of arguments (tensors or other types).

         The context can be used to store arbitrary data that can be then
         retrieved during the backward pass. Tensors should not be stored
         directly on `ctx` (though this is not currently enforced for
         backward compatibility). Instead, tensors should be saved either with
         :func:`ctx.save_for_backward` if they are intended to be used in
         ``backward`` (equivalently, ``vjp``) or :func:`ctx.save_for_forward`
         if they are intended to be used for in ``jvp``.


      .. py:method:: backward(ctx, grad_x_quant)
         :staticmethod:

         Defines a formula for differentiating the operation with backward mode
         automatic differentiation (alias to the vjp function).

         This function is to be overridden by all subclasses.

         It must accept a context :attr:`ctx` as the first argument, followed by
         as many outputs as the :func:`forward` returned (None will be passed in
         for non tensor outputs of the forward function),
         and it should return as many tensors, as there were inputs to
         :func:`forward`. Each argument is the gradient w.r.t the given output,
         and each returned value should be the gradient w.r.t. the
         corresponding input. If an input is not a Tensor or is a Tensor not
         requiring grads, you can just pass None as a gradient for that input.

         The context can be used to retrieve tensors saved during the forward
         pass. It also has an attribute :attr:`ctx.needs_input_grad` as a tuple
         of booleans representing whether each input needs gradient. E.g.,
         :func:`backward` will have ``ctx.needs_input_grad[0] = True`` if the
         first input to :func:`forward` needs gradient computated w.r.t. the
         output.



   .. py:property:: scale_factor

      Scale factor of quantizer

      :returns: The value with which a float tensor is multiplied
                in order to scale it to Integer numerical range

   .. py:method:: quantize(x)

      Apply quantization operation to input tensor

      :param x: Floating-point input
      :param rounded: Round the rescaled input to Integers

      :returns: Output quantized to Integer range
